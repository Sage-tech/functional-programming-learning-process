SKILLS
Design a minimally-powerful monad transformer stack
Write concurrent and streaming programs
Use purely functional mocking in tests
Use type classes to modularly model different effects
Recognize type patterns & abstract over them
Use functional libraries in novel ways
Use optics to manipulate state
Write custom lawful monad transformers
Use free monads / extensible effects to separate concerns
Encode invariants at the type level
Effectively use FDs / type families to create safer code
