# Ladder of Functional Programming

This training will use the [Standardized Ladder of Functional Programming](https://twitter.com/lambda_conf/status/803695008100466688) to guide what is covered and in which order.

> The names were imported from the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition, but we will be making a few short-term tweaks & refactor next year

## Specific Criticisms of Ladder

There are some valid criticisms of the ladder. First, the terms used are focused on the Haskell eco system and typed functional programming languages, not functional programming in general. Second, especially at the mid and higher levels, there are concepts that may be of less value based on the situation.

Regardless of the criticisms, there is value that can be derrived, specifically additional ideas to explore and understand.

> The language here is also presumptuous. To be proficient, you must know about codata and extensible effects. Absurd.

## Identify Your Knowledge Level

[This gist](https://gist.github.com/kana-sama/735549b8baaa783d6fc563e65f3299d5) uses categories for each concept and skill to guage their understanding at a period in time. 

* Know about it
* Understanding
* Clear understanding
